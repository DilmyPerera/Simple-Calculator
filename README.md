## Code Structure

### `Calculator` Component:
The main component of the app, responsible for:
1. Accepting two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) via input fields.
2. Performing arithmetic calculations and displaying results in a table.

### Hooks Used:
- `useState`: Manages the state of the input numbers (`num1` and `num2`).

---

## CSS Styling
The styling for the calculator is managed in the `Calculator.css` file. It handles:
- Table layout for inputs and results.
- Center alignment and proper spacing between elements.

---

## Usage

1. Enter a value for **Number 1**.
2. Enter a value for **Number 2**.
3. The results for all operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division) will be displayed dynamically in the table.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add advanced features like square roots, percentages, or exponential calculations.
- Improve the UI with a responsive design.
- Display error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero).
